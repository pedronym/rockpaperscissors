# Rock, Paper, scissors
-----
## Small JavaScript exercise.

#### My minimum goal was that the game base was dynamic, meaning you can increase the number of possibilities (besides Rock, Paper or Scissors) and the game will react accordingly.

#### This is made using basic html, css and javascript. No dependencies, no Bower/NPM/Yarn. Just open the index.html in a browser and try it out.
